   /* 给定一个整数数组 A，以及一个整数 target 作为目标值，返回满足 i < j < k 且 A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target 的
    元组 i, j, k 的数量。
     由于结果会非常大，请返回 结果除以 10^9 + 7 的余数。
     示例 1：
     输入：A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
    输出：20
    解释：
    按值枚举（A[i]，A[j]，A[k]）：
    (1, 2, 5) 出现 8 次；
    (1, 3, 4) 出现 8 次；
    (2, 2, 4) 出现 2 次；
    (2, 3, 3) 出现 2 次。
     示例 2：
     输入：A = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
    输出：12
    解释：
    A[i] = 1，A[j] = A[k] = 2 出现 12 次：
    我们从 [1,1] 中选择一个 1，有 2 种情况，
    从 [2,2,2,2] 中选出两个 2，有 6 种情况。
     提示：
     3 <= A.length <= 3000
     0 <= A[i] <= 100
     0 <= target <= 300
